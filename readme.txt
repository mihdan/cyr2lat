== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I define my own substitutions? =

Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
 * Modify conversion table.
 *
 * @param array $table Conversion table.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function my_ctl_table( $table ) {
   $table['Ъ'] = 'U';
   $table['ъ'] = 'u';

   return $table;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_table', 'my_ctl_table' );
`

= How can I redefine non-standard locale? =

For instance, if your non-standard locale is uk_UA, you can redefine it to `uk` by adding the following code to your theme's `function.php` file:

`
/**
 * Use non-standard locale.
 *
 * @param string $locale Current locale.
 *
 * @return string
 */
function my_ctl_locale( $locale ) {
	if ( 'uk_UA' === $locale ) {
		return 'uk';
	}

	return $locale;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_locale', 'my_ctl_locale' );
`

= How can I define own transliteration of titles? =

Add similar code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
 * Filter title before sanitizing.
 *
 * @param string|false $result Sanitized title.
 * @param string       $title  Title.
 *
 * @return string|false
 */
function my_ctl_pre_sanitize_title( $result, $title ) {
	if ( 'пиво' === $title ) {
		return 'beer';
	}

	return $result;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_pre_sanitize_title', 10, 2 );
`

= How can I define own transliteration of filenames? =

Add similar code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
 * Filter filename before sanitizing.
 *
 * @param string|false $result   Sanitized filename.
 * @param string       $filename Title.
 *
 * @return string|false
 */
function my_ctl_pre_sanitize_filename( $result, $filename ) {
	if ( 'пиво' === $filename ) {
		return 'beer';
	}

	return $result;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_pre_sanitize_filename', 10, 2 );
`

= How can I allow the plugin to work on the frontend? =

Add similar code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
 * Filter status allowed Cyr To Lat plugin to work.
 *
 * @param bool $allowed
 *
 * @return bool
 */
function my_ctl_allow( bool $allowed ): bool {
	$uri = isset( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ?
		sanitize_url( wp_unslash( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ) :
		'';

	if ( 0 === strpos( $uri, '/divi-comments' ) ) {
		return true;
	}

	return $allowed;
}

add_filter( 'ctl_allow', 'my_ctl_allow' );
`

= How can I limit post types for background conversion? =

Add similar code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
/**
 * Filter post types allowed for background conversion.
 *
 * @param array $post_types Allowed post types.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function my_ctl_post_types( $post_types ) {
	return [
		'post'          => 'post',
		'page'          => 'page',
		'attachment'    => 'attachment',
		'product'       => 'product',
		'nav_menu_item' => 'nav_menu_item',
	];
}
add_filter( 'ctl_post_types', 'my_ctl_post_types' );
`

= How can I convert many posts/terms using wp-cli? =

Use the following command in the console:

`
wp cyr2lat regenerate [--post_type=<post_type>] [--post_status=<post_status>]
`

Where
  `-post_type` is list of post types,
  `-post_status` is list of post statuses.

= How can I regenerate thumbnails safely? =

Regeneration of thumbnails with the command `wp media regenerate` can break links in old posts as file names become transliterated.

To avoid it, deactivate cyr2lat plugin during regeneration:

`
wp media regenerate --skip-plugins=cyr2lat
`

= Can I contribute? =

Yes you can!
